Technologies:

	-I mainly used object-oriented javascript, got most my help from the web to code it when i had trouble.
	-Referenced a "mousetrap" JS file for the keyboard shortcuts



Approach:

	-When i started the project i layed it out as a flashcard creator. (regrettably didnt read project requirements)
	-I started with a basic css/html layout, then worked on my functions in javascript.



Unsolved Problems:

	-I scratched my hanoi towers project late in the week (Wednesday morning)
	-Read thurs morning that i needed to have answers and card memories of ones that were missed, and also keyboard shortcuts; sadly didnt get around to doing the answer/memory but did incorporate keyboard strokes with a quick fix.



Stories:

	-As a user, i should be able to create flashcards for my own use.
	-As a developer, i should provide clean code that is read easily.
	-As a user, i should be able to use keystrokes to swap through cards for ease of use.
	-As a Developer, i should provide a screen that is easy to navigate without the user having to ask questions about 	how it works.
	-As a User, i should be able to have fun and learn with a bug-free website.



Note:

	-Also didnt create an original repository to commit to, i had multiple files i was going back and forth with locally, so that is why there is only one commit.
